* MP3
    smpeg.dll (used for mp3 playback) tends to crash unexpectedly. It's
    encouraged to use OGG, instead. Use MP3 at your own risk.
    This is officially not a bug. It's a feature.
* Debug mode
    When running in language debug mode and the debug thread is waiting for
    input, the program will not end until *any* input (including an empty
    string) is given. The interpreter and the image loader will be destroyed
    cleanly (thereby commiting user data to disk), so it's otherwise completely
    safe.
    The thread can be killed early with "exit" or "quit".
* Linux
    XMMS has been known to to clash with the sound library to the point that
    only one of the two can be playing sound at a time.
* Miscellanea
    Vertical centering produces incorrect results when the size of a page of
    text is greater than the size of the screen. This will probably be fixed in
    future releases.
