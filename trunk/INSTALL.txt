This document describes the compilation and/or installation for the various
platforms.

Windows:
Compilation:
Compiling for Windows is pretty much straightforward. The src package includes
projects for Code::Blocks and Visual C++ 2008, plus binary static and dynamic
dependencies. The only thing noteworthy is that ONSlaught doesn't compile with
MinGW 3.x and below; only with MinGW 4.x and above. This is because 3.x has an
incomplete implementation of the C++ standard library.

Unices:
Compilation:
cmake .
make
In order for the compilation process to succeed, the following files/symlinks
should be in the system's libraries directory (usually /usr/lib):

libSDL.so                              │    libSDL.a            (Alternatively)
libSDL_image.so                        │    libSDL_image.a      (Alternatively)
libSDL_mixer.so                        │    libSDL_mixer.a      (Alternatively)
libbz2.so                              │    libbz2.a            (Alternatively)
libfreetype.so                         │    libfreetype.a       (Alternatively)

After a successful build, the binary will be put in ./ONSlaught.

There's also a separate package (fulldep) that includes all the dependecies with
their sources, in case the target system doesn't have them. This package is
almost guaranteed to produce a correct executable.

Installation:
The best way to install is to move this file to /usr/bin/ (most likely will
require root priviledges). Failing that, ~/bin/ should also work.
