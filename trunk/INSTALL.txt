This document describes the compilation and/or installation for the various
platforms.

Windows:
Compilation:
Compiling for Windows is pretty much straightforward. The src package includes
projects for Visual C++ 2008, plus static dependencies. The
only thing noteworthy is that ONSlaught doesn't compile with MinGW 3.x and
below; only with MinGW 4.x and above. This is because 3.x has an incomplete
implementation of the C++ standard library.

To compile using MinGW, you'll also need MSYS. Run
  make -f Makefile.MSYS
This will build both the engine and the plugin.

Runtime:
A binary built with the static libraries and built scripts provided has no
external dependencies. Compiling with MinGW automatically generates a
DLL (plugin.dll). This DLL is also included in the Windows binary package. It
is a purely optional component provided as an example of what can be done with
the plugin interface.


Unices:
Compilation:
  cmake .
  make

After a successful build, the binary will be put in ./ONSlaught.

There's also a separate package (fulldep) that includes all the dependecies
with their sources, in case the target system doesn't have them. This package
is almost guaranteed to produce a correct executable.

Installation:
The best way to install is to move this file to /usr/bin/ (most likely will
require root priviledges). Failing that, ~/bin/ should also work.
