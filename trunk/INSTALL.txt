This document describes the compilation and/or installation for the various
platforms.

Windows:
Compilation:
Compiling for Windows is pretty much straightforward. The src package includes
projects for Visual C++ 2008, plus static dependencies. The only thing
noteworthy is that ONSlaught doesn't compile with MinGW 3.x and below; only
with MinGW 4.x and above. This is because 3.x has an incomplete implementation
of the C++ standard library.

To compile using MinGW, you'll also need MSYS. Run
  make -f Makefile.MSYS

Runtime:
A binary built with the static libraries and build scripts provided has no
external dependencies.
Note that building with VC++ also produces a file called "ONSlaught.lib" (the
MinGW equivalent is "libONSlaught.a"). This file is only used to build optional
modules, such as the video player. You can safely delete it if you don't need
to do this.


Unices:
Compilation:
  cmake .
  make

After a successful build, the binary will be put in ./ONSlaught.

There's also a separate package (fulldep) that includes all the dependecies
with their sources, in case the target system doesn't have them. This package
is almost guaranteed to produce a correct executable.

For people with more than one CPU core:
By adding -jn (replacing n with the number of CPU cores youre system has) to
the make command line you can significantly decrease the compilation time.

Installation:
The best way to install is to move this file to /usr/bin/ (most likely will
require root priviledges). Failing that, ~/bin/ should also work.
