    * Bug fixes.

    * Added zip tool.
    * Added support for arbitrarily-sized files to archive tools.

20090407
    * Added -l option to crypt for backwards compatibility with NSDEC.exe.

20090208
    * Nearly no changes. Last release until I can crack this SPB compression
      thing.

20080126
    * First release separate from the main archive.
    * Added nsaio to replace the old ONScripter programs. Don't expect this to
      ever be ported to anything other than Windows and Linux. Boost is not easy
      to link against.
    * Added distribution-independent Linux binaries.
