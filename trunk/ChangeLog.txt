  transmode

Important changes:

    archives without extracting them or loading them to memory.

    implementation.

    TODO: Implement user-level interface and save mechanism.

Minor changes:
  * Implemented enforcement of command execution to the *define and *start
    blocks.
  * Discontinued UCS-2 support.
  * Implemented reduced memory consumption builds for low memory environments.
    Note: Macros are disabled in this state.
  * Implemented color correction in video player.

        drawclear, drawfill, drawsp, drawsp2, drawsp3, drawtext, allsphide,
        allspresume, mov3, mov4, ..., mov10, selnum, humanorder, loadgosub,
        defsub, user commands, getparam, getcursor, useescspc, getpage,
        getenter, gettab, getfunction, getinsert, getzxc, usewheel,
        shadedistance, tablegoto, indent, getscreenshot, deletescreenshot,

        puttext, labellog, underline.

    * Changed implementation of expression evaluator to a Bison-generated
        parser-evaluator. Because of MinGW's poor implementation, the code can
        no longer be compiled with it.
    * Discontinued support for O/NScripter savegames (save*.dat).
    * The array identification method has changed from C-style identifiers to
        integers. As a result, all savegames for scripts that use arrays will be
        incorrectly loaded.
    * Labels are now C-style identifiers (sort of).
    * Added string concatenation support in expressions.
    * Added asynchronous animation support for all layers.
    * Added full sprite string support (see doc/NScrAPI/NScrAPI.xml#lsp) for the

        wavestop had been issued on channel X while no sound was loaded at that
        channel.
    * Fixed crash involving screen interpolation and fullscreen switching.
    * And so on...
