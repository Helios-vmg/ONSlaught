This is an optional plugin for ONSlaught that enables the engine to read SVG
files. It uses QtSVG, which implements a subset of the SVG standard, known as
SVG Tiny. The plugin interface includes for resource management, picture
scaling, rotation, linear transformations, and of course rasterization.
If you wish to compile it, you'll have to install the Qt toolkit.

Future plans include supporting a larger portion of the SVG standard.
