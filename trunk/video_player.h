/*
 * video_playback_fp:
 *
 * Description (C_play_video()):
 *     Plays a video using libVLC for parsing, decoding, and audio output, and
 *     SDL for video output.
 *     The video, audio, and subtitle streams to use will be the default ones,
 *     if they exist.
 *     Subtitle redering depends on available plugins.
 *     The function requires exclusive access to the destination surface, so if
 *     there are other threads running in the caller program that could read or
 *     write to the surface, either they should be stopped, or accesses to the
 *     surface should be locked with a mutex.
 *     If the video and the destination surface are of different dimensions, an
 *     interpolation function will be applied to each frame.
 *     If the video and the destination surface are of different aspect ratios,
 *     the video is sized and positioned so that it fits completely inside the
 *     surface. For example, playing a 1920x1080 (16:9) video on a
 *     1024x768 (4:3) surface would produce a letterboxed picture, while doing
 *     the opposite would produce a pillarboxed picture.
 *     The function clears (i.e. fill with black) the destination before, but
 *     not after being finishing. That job is left to the caller.
 *     Like any video-related code, the function is rather resource-consuming.
 *     The computational requirements depend on the kind of codec used by the
 *     video. The exact memory requirements depend on: the size of the screen,
 *     the size of the video, and the kind of codec and container used.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *     void *player
 *         The pointer returned by new_player.
 *     void *parameters
 *         It should be a pointer to a C_play_video_params structure. See below
 *         for details.
 * Returns:
 *     0 if the function failed, anything else otherwise.
 *
 * C_play_video_params:
 *     This structure is designed to allow ABI compatibility between different
 *     dynamic library versions.
 *     Its members are:
 *     ulong version
 *         The structure version that the client application is using. Set this
 *         to C_PLAY_VIDEO_PARAMS_VERSION. If this version is higher than the
 *         one the library was built for, the funtion will fail.
 *     SDL_Surface *screen
 *         A pointer to the SDL_Surface that the video will be rendered to. The
 *         surface *must* be the real screen (i.e. the pointer returned by
 *         SDL_SetVideoMode()).
 *     const char *input
 *         The path to the video file to be played.
 *     void *user_data
 *         This pointer will be passed to the callback functions if they are
 *         called.
 *     audio_output_cb audio_output
 *         Pointer to a function that handles writing to an audio device.
 *     ulong trigger_callback_pairs_n
 *         The size of the array pointed to by pairs.
 *     trigger_callback_pair *pairs
 *         A pointer to an array of pairs of int pointers and function
 *         pointers. The function continually checks each of the ints pointed
 *         to and, when it finds one that's !0, calls the associated function.
 *         All pointers must be valid. The function doesn't check them.
 *         The callbacks may not be ran from the same thread as the one that
 *         called C_play_video.
 *         All callbacks must return updated pointers to the screen. If a
 *         callback doesn't relocate the screen (e.g. by not calling
 *         SDL_SetVideoMode()), it should return the same value it was passed.
 *         Using callbacks may place the caller program under the GPL.
 *     int *stop
 *         The function continually checks the int pointed to by stop and
 *         returns as soon as possible when its value becomes !0. The pointer
 *         is not checked for validity.
 *     int print_debug
 *         The function writes debug messages to stdout if this is !0.
 *     char *exception_string
 *         A pointer to a char array that will be used to write extra error
 *         information in case the function fails.
 *     size_t exception_string_size
 *         The size of the buffer pointed to by exception_string. The function
 *         Will write at most this many characters to it.
