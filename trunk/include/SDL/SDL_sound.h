/**
 * @overview
 *
 * The basic gist of SDL_sound is that you use an SDL_RWops to get sound data
 *  into this library, and SDL_sound will take that data, in one of several
 *  popular formats, and decode it into raw waveform data in the format of
 *  your choice. This gives you a nice abstraction for getting sound into your
 *  game or application; just feed it to SDL_sound, and it will handle
 *  decoding and converting, so you can just pass it to your SDL audio
 *  callback (or whatever). Since it gets data from an SDL_RWops, you can get
 *  the initial sound data from any number of sources: file, memory buffer,
 *  network connection, etc.
 *
 * As the name implies, this library depends on SDL: Simple Directmedia Layer,
 *  which is a powerful, free, and cross-platform multimedia library. It can
 *  be found at http://www.libsdl.org/
 *
 * Support is in place or planned for the following sound formats:
 *   - .WAV  (Microsoft WAVfile RIFF data, internal.)
 *   - .VOC  (Creative Labs' Voice format, internal.)
 *   - .MP3  (MPEG-1 Layer 3 support, via the SMPEG library.)
 *   - .MID  (MIDI music converted to Waveform data, via Timidity.)
 *   - .MOD  (MOD files, via MikMod.)
 *   - .OGG  (Ogg files, via Ogg Vorbis libraries.)
 *   - .RAW  (Raw sound data in any format, internal.)
 *   - .CDA  (CD audio read into a sound buffer, internal.)
 *   - .AU
 *   - .AIFF
 *
 *   (...and more to come...)
 *
 * Please see the file COPYING in the source's root directory.

/**
 * Start decoding a new sound sample. The data is read via an SDL_RWops
 *  structure (see SDL_rwops.h in the SDL include directory), so it may be
 *  coming from memory, disk, network stream, etc. The (ext) parameter is
 *  merely a hint to determining the correct decoder; if you specify, for
 *  example, "mp3" for an extension, and one of the decoders lists that
 *  as a handled extension, then that decoder is given first shot at trying
 *  to claim the data for decoding. If none of the extensions match (or the
 *  extension is NULL), then every decoder examines the data to determine if
 *  it can handle it, until one accepts it. In such a case your SDL_RWops will
 *  need to be capable of rewinding to the start of the stream.
 * If no decoders can handle the data, a NULL value is returned, and a human
 *  readable error message can be fetched from Sound_GetError().
 * Optionally, a desired audio format can be specified. If the incoming data
 *  is in a different format, SDL_sound will convert it to the desired format
 *  on the fly. Note that this can be an expensive operation, so it may be
 *  wise to convert data before you need to play it back, if possible, or
 *  make sure your data is initially in the format that you need it in.
 *  If you don't want to convert the data, you can specify NULL for a desired
 *  format. The incoming format of the data, preconversion, can be found
 *  in the Sound_Sample structure.
 * Note that the raw sound data "decoder" needs you to specify both the
 *  extension "RAW" and a "desired" format, or it will refuse to handle
 *  the data. This is to prevent it from catching all formats unsupported
 *  by the other decoders.
 * Finally, specify an initial buffer size; this is the number of bytes that
 *  will be allocated to store each read from the sound buffer. The more you
 *  can safely allocate, the more decoding can be done in one block, but the
 *  more resources you have to use up, and the longer each decoding call will
 *  take. Note that different data formats require more or less space to
 *  store. This buffer can be resized via Sound_SetBufferSize() ...
 * The buffer size specified must be a multiple of the size of a single
 *  sample point. So, if you want 16-bit, stereo samples, then your sample
 *  point size is (2 channels * 16 bits), or 32 bits per sample, which is four
 *  bytes. In such a case, you could specify 128 or 132 bytes for a buffer,
 *  but not 129, 130, or 131 (although in reality, you'll want to specify a
 *  MUCH larger buffer).
 * When you are done with this Sound_Sample pointer, you can dispose of it
 *  via Sound_FreeSample().
 * You do not have to keep a reference to (rw) around. If this function
 *  suceeds, it stores (rw) internally (and disposes of it during the call
 *  to Sound_FreeSample()). If this function fails, it will dispose of the
 *  SDL_RWops for you.
