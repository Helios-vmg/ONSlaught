In order to use the console, two conditions must be met:
1. ONSlaught has to be started with the -debug command line option.
2. The font file "cout.ttf" needs to be in the working directory. Alternatively,
   the path to the font file can be provided in the configuration file using the
   variable "console font".

Console controls:
UP and DOWN: Navigate the command history.
CTRL+UP and CTRL+DOWN: Navigate the console history.
TAB: Autocomplete.

Console commands:
_get: Evaluate an expression and print its result to the console (e.g.
_get 1+2*3 or _get %variable). The expression can evaluate to a string or an
integer.
quit: Immediately terminates the engine.
Everything else: Is directly interpreted. If the command line can't be
interpreted immediately for safety reasons, it's queued for interpretation at
the end of the current command. Commands that aren't queued: add, atoi, cmp,
cos, date, date2, dec, dim, div, effect, fileexist, getbgmvol, getbtntimer,
getcursorpos, getini, getlog, getmp3vol, gettext, gettimer, getversion, inc,
intlimit, isfull, ispage, itoa, itoa2, len, mid, mod, mov, mov3, mov4, mov5,
mov6, mov7, mov8, mov9, mov10, movl, mul, rnd, rnd2, sin, split, tan, time.
