Explanation: I don't know what the original programmer had in mind, but I
completely disagree with command-specific syntax. The syntax of a language
should be as regular as possible. These are the only accepted syntaxes for all
commands:
(#=any number of parameters)
command #
command #,
#
command # : command #
command #/
,#
