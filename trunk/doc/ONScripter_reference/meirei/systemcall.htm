<h2>systemcall</h2>
<h3>systemcall &lt;function&gt;</h3>
<p>
Works identically to the system menu.<br>
If you use it in things like select/selgosub, then you'll end up with something not very different from the title screen.<br>
(In this case, it would probably be better to temporarily toggle off right-click menu functionality through rmode)<br>
The available commands are exactly the same as the ones utilize by rmenu.<br>
<br>
If you call "systemcall rmenu", this is the same as calling the right-click menu itself.<br>
You'd use this when you wanted right-click menu functionality during a button wait state.  Once you exit this right-click menu, the interpreter continues its execution one line below the systemcall command.<br>
(This can leave the screen and the interpreter stack in an inconsistent state, so be careful when using this command.)
