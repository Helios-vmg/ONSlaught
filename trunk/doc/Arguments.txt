This file describes the command line arguments that can be passed to ONSlaught
to tweak its behavior.
If a file exists in the working directory called "arguments.txt", ONSlaught
will read its contents as UTF-8 and use them as though they were command line
arguments.
The actual command line arguments are processed /after/ the contents of this
file.


Usage: ONSlaught [options]

-h
-?
--help
Shows a message with all options.


--version
Display version number.


-implementation
Lists all implemented and unimplemented commands.


-save-directory <directory name>
Override the default save game subdirectory with a custom name.
By default, the engine performs a partial SHA1 on the loaded script (not on the
script file) and uses the first 64 bits to create a directory.
For example, calling ONSlaught without this option might cause the save games to
go in "C:\Users\User\My Documents\.ONSlaught\e38ba7ef 3bd29d16\" on Windows 7,
and in "~/.ONSlaught/e38ba7ef 3bd29d16/" on UNIX, which is very cumbersome.
Using the following command line:
ONSlaught -save-directory "Parrot Sketch"
would cause save games to go in
"C:\Users\User\My Documents\.ONSlaught\Parrot Sketch\" under Windows XP, and in
"~/.ONSlaught/Parrot Sketch/" under UNIX.

At the time of this writing (2011-02-11), this option only has effect on UNIX
and Windows. Any other platform the engine is compiled for will put its save
game files in the working directory.

Directory name suggestion: In order to avoid conflicts for systems with multiple
games installed, the best naming scheme would probably be
<Game name>-<ISO 639-1 Code>[-<version>]. The version is optional (note that
it's not always possible or reliable to load save games for one
script version into a different script version).
For example, for an English version of Tsukihime, version 1.5: Tsukihime-en-1.5
For the Czech version: Tsukihime-cs-1.5

-verbosity <number>
Sets the level of verbosity. Defaults to 0.
Levels:
Level 0: No logging.
Level 1: Log line numbers being interpreted.
Level 2: Log file streams being closed and opened.
Level 3: Log file open failures.
Level 4: Log results and details for expressions.
Level >5: Log all commands being executed and their parameters.
Level 255: Reserved for engine debugging.


-f
Start in fullscreen.


-r <number> <number> <number> <number>
Sets the screen resolution. The first two numbers are width and height of the
virtual screen (script coordinates should be given based on this resolution).
The second two numbers are width and height of the physical screen, or window,
graphical output will go to. Linear interpolation is used to resize the picture,
so the rescale ratio (realResolution/virtualResolution) should never be above 2
(for example, if the virtual resolution is 640x480, the real resolution should
not be greater than 1280x960). Interpolation artifacts are obvious for scales
greater than 2. If the ratios don't match, the difference will be compensated
with vertical black bars at the sides or horizontal bars at the top and bottom,
depending on the case. The picture is never cropped. Wasted screen space is
better than lost pixels, specially for resizes such as 16:9->4:3.


-script {auto|<path> <encryption method>}
Selects a script file and encryption method or enables auto-selection. Default
is auto.
Files are searched in this order (in auto):

 1. "0.txt", mode 0
 2. "00.txt", mode 0
 3. "nscr_sec.dat", mode 2
 4. "nscript.___", mode 3
 5. "nscript.dat", mode 1

Encryption mode (technical) details:
Mode 0, or no encryption.
Mode 1, or xor84: unencrypted_byte[i]=encrypted_byte[i]^0x84;
Mode 2, or rotating xor: Given an array ring[]={0x79,0x57,0x0D,0x80,0x04},
    unencrypted_byte[i]=encrypted_byte[i]^ring[i%5].
Mode 3, or transform and xor: Not supported.


-encoding {auto|sjis|iso-8859-1|utf8}
Selects the encoding to be used on the script file. Default is auto.


-dump-text <filename>
Enables text dump mode. All script text is outputted to the file given. The
contents of the file are kept between executions.


-s
Disables sound.
This doesn't just zeroes the volume, it avoids sound initialization. With this
flag, sound can't be turned back on without restarting the engine.


-music-format {auto|ogg|mp3|mid|it|xm|s3m|mod|aiff}
Selects the music format to be used. 'auto's priority is as follows: ogg, mp3,
mid, it, xm, s3m, mod, aiff.


-music-directory <directory>
Selects where to look for the music. Defaults to "./CD"


-redirect
Redirects stdout to "stdout.txt" and stderr to "stderr.txt".
This option unconditionally disables debug.


-!redirect
Sends the output to the console instead of the file system.
See "-redirect" for more info.


-!reset-out-files
Only used with "-redirect".
Keeps the contents of stdout.txt, stderr.txt, and stdlog.txt when it opens them
and puts the date and time as identification.


-debug
Enables debug mode. In debug mode, it is possible to view and change the value
of variables, and to run some commands. To enter debug mode, hit Pause/Break.


-stop-on-first-error
Stops executing the script when the first error occurs. "Unimplemented command"
(when the command will not be implemented) errors don't count.


-pp-output <filename>
Writes the preprocessor output to <filename>. The details of each macro call are
sent to stderr.


-pp-then-quit
Preprocesses the script and quits. Only makes sense when used with -pp-output.


-disable-threading
Disables threading for blit operations.


-play <filename>
Play a file and quit. The file can be a graphics, audio, or video file.
This option can be used to test whether the engine can find and read the file.


-replace <replacement string>
Sets characters to be replaced in the printing mechanism.
Odd characters in the string are characters to be replaced, and even characters
are the characters that will replace them.
For example:
-replace "aABb"
This example replaces lower case 'a's with upper case 'A's, and upper case 'B's
with lower case 'b's.
(The string only needs to be quoted if it contains spaces or other special
characters.)


-use-long-audio-buffers
Allocates longer audio buffers. This fixes some problems with sound in older
systems.
